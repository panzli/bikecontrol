## Description

With BikeControl you can **control your favorite trainer app** using your Zwift Click, Zwift Ride, Zwift Play, Shimano Di2, or other similar devices. Here's what you can do with it, depending on your configuration:
- Virtual Gear shifting
- Steering / navigation
- adjust workout intensity
- control music on your device
- more? If you can do it via keyboard, mouse, or touch, you can do it with BikeControl
